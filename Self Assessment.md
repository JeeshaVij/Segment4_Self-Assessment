# Self Assessment

- In this group project, I created a relational database(RDS) on AWS and made the server connection via pgadmin
- I then created a connection string to connect to the database using "psycopg2" in the jupyter notebook
- Two dataframes were created for the two tables in pgadmin through running a sql query in the jupyter notebook
- The two tables were joined by running a sql query in the jupyter notebook
- I performed the exploratory data analysis and established the relationships and how they could be useful in making predictions about how the 
  features are linked to the quality 
- Furthermore, I helped in the machine learning task too. I performed the random forest model which was merged into the final code in the
  jupyter notebook.


# Team Assessment

There was lack of team work. One of the members left in the second week without any communication. I faced a lot of coordination issues.

# Summary of Project

This project explores the Red Wine Quality Data Set of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine., available on the UCI machine learning repository 
(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality). In our project, we have created a ML model to try and make prediction about the 
quality of the Portuguese wine as average or good. In a laboratory, all the features were recorded. So, alcohol, sulphates, ph., density all 
those features were recorded, but then a human sensory taste measure, which is quality was recorded as well, so we have used the machine 
learning model to see how we can link these features to the quality of the wine.
